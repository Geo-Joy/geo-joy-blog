      <description>Addon Prelude Read the article from intel developers zone.https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/a-closer-look-at-object-detection-recognition-and-tracking
 Prelude I have taken the explanation from towardsdatascience.com - Understanding SSD MultiBox — Real-Time Object Detection In Deep Learningand further simplified it for much better understanding. Especially for the slow ones like me :P
Architecture of SSD mean Average Precision (mAP) Lets try to understand what is Average Precision:e.g. Let’s say, we recommended 7 products to a customer and the 1st, 4th, 5th, 6th product recommended was correct.</description>
