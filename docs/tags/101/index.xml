      <description>The Machine Learning Landscape 1. What is Machine Learning?  It is the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.  2. Types of Machine Learning  Whether or not they are trained with human supervision  Supervised Learning Unsupervised Learning Semisupervised Learning Reinforcement Learning   Whether or not they can learn incrementally on the fly  Online Learning Batch Learning   Whether they work by simly comparing new data points to known data points, or instead detect patterns in the training data and build a predictive model, much like scientists do.</description>

      <description>image borrowed from UDACITYData Dimentions We fist need to understand how we represent the data specifically the shape the data can have.
Eg: we can have a number representing a person height or a list of numbers for height, weight, age etc. May be a display picture represented as grid having rows and columns of each individual pixels and each pixels having its color value for RED, BLUE, GREEN.
We describe this data in terms of number of dimentions.</description>
