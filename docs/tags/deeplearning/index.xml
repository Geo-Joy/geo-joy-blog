      <description>image borrowed from UDACITYRecurrent Neural Network is one of the advanced algorithms that existed in the wold of supervised deep learning.
Prelude In ANN and CNN we use neural network that takes few inputs, propagates it forward through hidden layers to the output layer. This is termed as a FEED FORWARD NETWORK. In this network there is no sence of order in the inputs.
OK now lets bring some order to the network.</description>
